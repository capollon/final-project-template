# MUSA 611 Final Project Template

# An ecosystem for ART specific opportunities in Philly

**Problem:** Career sites such as LinkedIn and Glassdoor are catered to the interests of White collar--corporate America jobs. Very rarely can creators find opportunities quickly, easily, and centrally. Creators are forced to peruse on numerous sites and keep an eye out for flyers as they stroll past the gentlemen playing chess in Clark Park.


#*This site aims to serve as a node for Philly-based Creators, designers, and part-time/ "side-gigers" to find opportunities that match their passions with their neighbors!*


## The Purpose

-   For design related gigs, neighbors in Philly can put up virtual flyers online. Local creators seeking work can go to this central site to find opportunities nearest to them and even curate a relationship with a neighbor they hadn't known yet!
-   This site also acts as an idea hub, for creators/ organizations to post their ideas and RFPs on the website with their respective due dates, guidelines, and location.



## For the User:

-   For developers, small businesses, residents, and anyone who needs a designer's eye or assistance on a project.
-   Creative "idea hub" and opportunity hub for makers and creators in Philly
-   Connects creators to their neighbors to find local opportunities and cultivate community
-   Neighbors helping neighbors
